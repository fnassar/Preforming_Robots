### Script
#### Idenity:
Robot characters: 
- 3antar -> Jannah and Fatema -> Identity: (egyptian/arab)
- < name1 > -> Hamad and Yerk -> Identity: (Exploring/finding/understanding) --suggestion
- < name2 > -> Shanaia and Aadhar -> Identity: (South Aisian) --suggestion
- < name3 > -> Nouf and Shaikha -> Identity: (Emarati/Gulf) --suggestion
- < name4 > -> Akhat and Yunho -> Identity: (central/east aisian?) --suggestion
- < name5 > -> Andres and Ryan -> Identity: (Exploring/finding/understanding) --suggestion
- < name6 > -> Akif and Marta -> Therapist/counselor robot

__The idea__ is of a comedic script showing a group of robots trying to find room to fit in in a new enviroment.\

#### __ACT 1__: 2 humans woke up as robots and are left confused
name5  *to no one in particular*: ** "I woke up today and I was not human, a new world of robots and I am trying to find my path"\
name2  *to <name5>*: ** "Dude, same I dont know what's happening. There seems to be groups over there, idk man I am confusedddd"\
name5  *to <name2>*: ** "wait u too? this is sadd, what about our human form what where you"\
name2  *to <name5>*: ** "Heh, I was a mix of stuff. OOOOOOOO THAT IS WHY I CAME UP IN NO GROUPS"\
name5  *to <name2>*: ** "Ohh... me too. i guess"\

#### __ACT 2__: 2 older robots talking before they notice the other 2 robots in the back confused and maybe crying
*3antar dancing in the middle*\
*name3  comes up to them*\
name3 : ** *sarcastic but annoyed* "my man what are you doing! I am betraying my wires to get married here what are you doing please"\
3antar: ** *dramaticly* "girl! you think my creator is happy with this, I will end up running away, at least the egyptian batteries are still giving me life, I could be dead"\
name3 : ** *sighs* "why do I even..."\
name3 : ** *sees name2 and name5* "wait are they lost, 3antar look at them they're looping around they'll break their wires"\

*3antar and name3 go up to name2 and name5*\
3antar: ** "yoooo, y'all good?"\
name3 : ** *whispers* "do they look good? be nice""what do i see in him idk"\
name5 : ** "man I was human yesterday I have no clue what's happening"\
name2 : ** *Screatching* "dudddeeee me toooo dont leave me out of this"\
name5 : ** *says while sighing* "are you always like this?" "I am trying to get help here can u please just let me be for a second" *under his breath* "so childish"\
name2 : ** "okok im sorry do your thing, u better get me in on this tho" *toung out sound* *turns around and acts sad*\
name5 : ** "ill deal with him, name3, 3antar help please."\
